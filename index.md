# MATLAB 'snow-dots' toolbox
The repository [Lab-Matlab-Control](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Lab-Matlab-Control), which we have come to call _snow-dots_ in our lab, contains the core MATLAB functions that we use to run our Psychophysical experiments. Since this code requires several other dependencies to run properly, it is most conveniently used with [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox). It is in fact listed in the public [ToolboxRegistry](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxRegistry). Click [here](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/SingleCP_DotsReversal_Task/tree/psychophys_tests) for an example task code that uses _snow-dots_ in this way.
