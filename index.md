**Hello!**   
This page is meant to help you find your way through [TheGoldLab](https://github.com/TheGoldLab) GitHub organization.
This organization contains the public code from the [Gold Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/goldlab/).

# Code related to ongoing projects
## Auditory change-point task
- Code to run the experiment lives in [Task_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Task_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint). This task uses [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox).
- Code to run simulations and analyze the data lives in [Analysis_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint) and its documentation is accessible [here](https://thegoldlab.github.io/Analysis_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint/index.html).

## Single change-point dots-reversal task
- Code to run the experiment lives in [Task_SingleCP_DotsReversal](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Task_SingleCP_DotsReversal). This task uses [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox).
- Code to analyze data from experiment resides in [Analysis_SingleCP_DotsReversal](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_SingleCP_DotsReversal). 

## Databases of _random dots stimuli_ (Python 3)
The [dotsDB](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/dots_db) Python module is currently under development. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive API to create, edit and query from [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) databases containing our random dots stimuli.

# Code Tutorials
Click [here](https://thegoldlab.github.io/SnowDotsDocumentation/index.html) for broad documentation for SnowDots, Tower of Psych, and tutorials. 

We hope that the [Lab_Tutorials](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Lab_Tutorials) repo will help you in your quest to understanding our code. Here is a [Table of Contents](https://thegoldlab.github.io/SnowDotsDocumentation/TutorialsDocs/tutorials_TOC.html).

## _snow-dots_ toolbox (MATLAB)
The Snow Dots and Tower of Psych full documentation can be found at [this website](https://thegoldlab.github.io/SnowDotsDocumentation/DoxyDocs/index.html).

The repository [Lab_Matlab_Control](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Lab_Matlab_Control), which we have come to call _snow-dots_ in our lab, contains the core MATLAB functions that we use to run our Psychophysical experiments. Since this code requires several other dependencies to run properly, it is most conveniently used with [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox). It is in fact listed in the public [ToolboxRegistry](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxRegistry). Click [here](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/SingleCP_DotsReversal_Task/tree/psychophys_tests) for an example task code that uses _snow-dots_ in this way.
