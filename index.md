**Hello!** This page is meant to help you find your way through [TheGoldLab](https://github.com/TheGoldLab) GitHub organization.
This organization contains the public code from the [Gold Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/goldlab/).

# Code related to publications
The [Analysis_Archived](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_Archived) repository contains code associated with the following publications:
- [The Relative Influences of Priors and Sensory Evidence on an Oculomotor Decision Variable During Perceptual Learning](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.90629.2008)
- [Relationships between Pupil Diameter and Neuronal Activity in the Locus Coeruleus, Colliculi, and Cingulate Cortex](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.11.028)
- [Arousal-related adjustments of perceptual biases optimize perception in dynamic environments](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0107)
- [A biasâ€“variance trade-off governs individual differences in on-line learning in an unpredictable environment](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0297-4)

# Code related to ongoing projects
## Auditory change-point task
- Code to run the experiment lives in [Task_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Task_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint). This task uses [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox).
- Code to run simulations and analyze the data lives in [Analysis_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint) and its documentation is accessible [here](https://thegoldlab.github.io/Analysis_Audio2AFC_ChangePoint/index.html).

## Single change-point dots-reversal task
- Code to run the experiment lives in [Task_SingleCP_DotsReversal](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Task_SingleCP_DotsReversal). This task uses [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox).
- Code to analyze data from experiment resides in [Analysis_SingleCP_DotsReversal](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Analysis_SingleCP_DotsReversal). 

## Databases of _random dots stimuli_ (Python 3)
The [dotsDB](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/dots_db) Python module is currently under development. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive API to create, edit and query from [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) databases containing our random dots stimuli.

# _snow-dots_ toolbox (MATLAB)
The repository [Lab-Matlab-Control](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Lab-Matlab-Control), which we have come to call _snow-dots_ in our lab, contains the core MATLAB functions that we use to run our Psychophysical experiments. Since this code requires several other dependencies to run properly, it is most conveniently used with [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox). It is in fact listed in the public [ToolboxRegistry](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxRegistry). Click [here](https://github.com/TheGoldLab/SingleCP_DotsReversal_Task/tree/psychophys_tests) for an example task code that uses _snow-dots_ in this way.
